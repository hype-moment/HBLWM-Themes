# How to use

You have two simple and safe ways to use this script

1) Create an alias within your shell settings, which can be "Bash, Zsh, Sh, Fish ..."

Example: echo "alias hblwm-theme="sh ~/.config/herbstluftwm/themes/set_theme"" >> ~/.zshrc 
Note ... Change the .zshrc to your default shell file

In this example you just need to give the command "hblwm-theme" to use the script

2) You can run the script by passing to the command the absolute path of the script. "Not recommended"

Example: sh ~/.config/herbstluftwm/themes/set_theme

Note ... This process can be time consuming and unnecessary, I recommend the first option
